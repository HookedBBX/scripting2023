					<h3><b>A Gist of Who I am</b> </h3>

					<br>

					<p> On August 14, 1996, a not so celebrated child was born, at a simple yet happy province of
						Guiguinto,
						Bulacan, Philippines. His name is Victor Avelino V. De Guzman. He lives with his father Avelino
						De
						Guzman, his mother Victoria De Guzman, his sister Anna Victoria De Guzman and his brother Ronald
						De
						Guzman. They have a happy family, living in a simple house yet filled with love and affection.
					</p>

					<p>
						In his early years, he was exposed to music because of his father’s side job as a singer. Every
						day, he
						hears his father practice singing and playing the guitar and it even helps him sleep whenever he
						sings
						the “Desperado” by the well-known band Eagles. By the evening, when his brother Ronald comes
						home
						from college, he often hears him playing the piano. This explains how he developed learning
						piano at the
						age of 5 and played his debut performance in an established bank named Bank of the Philippine
						Islands
						on Christmas.
					</p>

					<p>Music became the foundation of Victor’s life. He keeps on discovering his talents to the point
						that he
						finds out another talent of his. It is called Human Beatboxing. After learning the basics, he
						didn’t stop
						the momentum and reached his prime resulting to straight 5 wins on Human Beatbox Competitions in
						the Philippines. He even joined International Competitions Online and won some tournaments. He
						loved
						Beatboxing so much and the community in the Philippines.</p>


					<p>On January 09, 2023, he got married to Angel Lee B. Aclan. From there, they started building
						their future
						from scratch, and finally decided to migrate to Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Leaving their
						families was
						hard but on August 11, 2023, they finally left their home country Philippines and started a new
						life in
						Canada.</p>


					<p>They are both currently employed, and Victor is balancing both his job and his studies. Despite
						their
						hectic schedules, they continue to call and be available for their family in the Philippines to
						maintain
						contact. Both Victor and Angel’s vision and goals are to help their families back in the
						Philippines and
						build a brighter future for their future children.</p>
